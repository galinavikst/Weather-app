# Weather-app
Every day I look at the weather forecast for today and the coming days. Why not make my own app? :smile:

This application includes semantic markup, CSS styles, adaptive to different devices. Shows data for this moment, today, and the next 5 days. You can also find any city or choose current geolocation.  The site was created with Api from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) and deployed on Netlify.

Just follow the [link](https://sparkly-raindrop-0a0717.netlify.app/) or clone the code and run it in your browser.
